                    I'm Jason Alvarez, a passionate software developer with a unique background in psychology. I hold a Master's degree from the <span className="text-amber-400">Chicago School of Professional Psychology üéì</span>, which gives me a unique perspective on human-centered design and user experience.

                <p>
                    I believe that great software is built by understanding human behavior and needs. My background in <span className="text-amber-400 font-medium">Industrial/Organizational Psychology</span> has taught me that humans make errors, and technology should be designed to minimize these errors while maximizing efficiency and user satisfaction.
                </p>

                
          <p>
            I'm continuously learning new technologies, building projects that solve real-world problems, and contributing to the developer community. When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking and exploring the outdoors, or expanding my world coin collection.
